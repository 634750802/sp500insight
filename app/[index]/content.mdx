# S&P500 Index
## Overview

This is a stock analysis demo that uses [TiDB Serverless](https://tidbcloud.com/) and [TiDB Cloud Data Service](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/data-service-overview).
We analyzed the data of the S&P 500 from 2013 to 2023 and used it as a dataset to build this application. You can get the dataset and code for [this demo](https://github.com/pingcap/sp500-insight-template), then you can rebuild the same application on your own TiDB Serverless Cluster for free.
